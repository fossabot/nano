**This is in active developement. [You can see the roadmap here.](https://trello.com/b/6uBEAJwj)**

Nano is a super lightweight Jekyll theme built to work great on all platforms, respect user privacy, and load at lightning-fast speeds.

### Installation
Installing Nano is simple. Start by downloading the latest version of Nano via [the releases page](https://github.com/doamatto/nano/releases/latest). Afterwards, using Gem, install bundler (`gem install bundler`). Then, run `bundle install` to install everything you need for Nano to work properly. You're now ready to configure your installation and deploy wherever. 

### Credits
Many thanks to the Jekyll and RubyGems community for great documentation, allowing me to make this simply and swiftly.

Big thanks to the StackOverflow community; they helped me find some nice CSS workarounds for some things (like missing images). I quoted the posts I used when I used them.

Special thanks to [Rishi](https://github.com/rveerepalli) for staying up late on the day before the launch of v0.3 to help fix some issues.
